Hi, i just wanted to say this python file does not install python so you will need to install it manually but if you dont have the requests library installed then just open requestsLibrary.py and it should hopefully install it
If youre having trouble downloading python, heres the official downloader of python 3.11.4: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/
Once youve donwloaded both you just need to right click the python file and select open with python 3.11
Also the dates in this program follow the YYYY-MM-DD format

And one last thing i am not affiliated with wynncraft in any way, nor do i claim to be, this is only a project that uses the wynncraft public API
